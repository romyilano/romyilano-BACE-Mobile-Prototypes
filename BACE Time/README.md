# Bace Time Bank Mobile App Prototype

This is just a prototype - its intention is first to inspire, provide a concrete
viewable prototype that can be touched. Later it will be hooked into the
open sourced back end of BACE.

For now we are using Parse just to set up dummy data

# Notes

ENABLE_BITCODE = NO for now - this will have to be turned back on when adding WatchKit
